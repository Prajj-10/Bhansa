Bhansa, which simply means "Kitchen" in Nepali, is a recipe sharing platform designed to connect people worldwide enabling them to discover, share, and recreate beloved recipes.
The concept of the application comes from various food that we make in our homes with out own unique touch. It aims to to preserve lost cultures from all around the world so that such recipes can be shared to upcoming generations and to the world.
This way each and every recipe that is here will be different, even if it's the same dish. It adds a touch of personalization from every single creator out there.
